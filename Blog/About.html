                        On my visit, my eyes were wide open with astonishment at the pristine
                         beauty that its blinding white sandbars and impressively azure waters
                          bring. They were inexplicably majestic and a quintessential canvass of
                           a natural wonder. For me, Balabac has simply the best island beaches 
                           in the Philippines by a long shot.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        I can go on, string words together to express my wonderment about this
                         quite elusive gem at the tail-end of Palawan, but it helps that I also
                          share some photos in the order based on how they showed out during my close 
                          to week-long trip.

                       <b>Note:</b> What I only share in this article is a list of island beaches, 
                        if you are looking for a comprehensive travel guide for Balabac.
